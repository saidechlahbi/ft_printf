va_start(ap, last_arg):

This macro initializes a va_list object ap to point to the first argument in the variable argument list.
last_arg is the name of the last named parameter in the function declaration.
This must be called before using va_arg to access the variable arguments.

va_arg(ap, type):

This macro retrieves the next argument from the variable argument list that ap points to.
type is the C data type of the argument you want to retrieve.
Each call to va_arg advances the ap pointer to the next argument.

va_copy(dest, src):

This macro makes a copy of the va_list object src and stores it in dest.
This is useful if you need to process the variable arguments multiple times without advancing the original ap pointer.

va_end(ap):

This macro must be called after you've finished processing the variable arguments.
It performs any necessary cleanup of the va_list object ap.




/// cases of error -1
Key error handling points:

Always check for NULL input
Handle NULL strings for %s
Check for incomplete format specifiers
Return -1 on error
Always call va_end before returning on error
Check write() return values
Handle buffer overflow situations in helper functions

These checks make your printf implementation more robust and safer to use.




## if after % is deferent to cspdiuxX% -1  is returned

## if str is NULL -1 is returned
